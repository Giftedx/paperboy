# Local Setup for Newspaper Downloader

This guide will help you set up the newspaper downloader to run on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A newspaper subscription with web login
- A Cloudflare R2 account (free tier) or AWS S3 account
- A SendGrid account (free tier) or Mailgun account

## Step 1: Configure Storage Provider

### Option A: Cloudflare R2 (Recommended)

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) if you don't have one
2. Navigate to R2 in the Cloudflare dashboard
3. Create a new R2 bucket (e.g., `newspaper-storage`)
4. Create an API token with read/write access to your bucket
5. Note your Account ID, Access Key ID, and Secret Access Key

For public access to your files, you'll need to set up:
- R2 bucket public access, or
- A Cloudflare Worker to serve files

### Option B: AWS S3

1. Create an AWS account if you don't have one
2. Create an S3 bucket with appropriate permissions
3. Create an IAM user with programmatic access and S3 permissions
4. Note your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

## Step 2: Configure Email Service

### Option A: SendGrid (Recommended)

1. Sign up for a [SendGrid account](https://signup.sendgrid.com/) (free tier allows 100 emails/day)
2. Create an API key with mail send permissions
3. Verify a sender email address

### Option B: Mailgun

1. Sign up for a [Mailgun account](https://signup.mailgun.com/new/signup) (free tier allows sending to authorized recipients)
2. Get your API key and domain information
3. Add recipients to your authorized recipients list (for the sandbox domain)

## Step 3: Configure the Application

1. Edit the configuration file at `~/.newspaper/config.yaml` with your settings:
   - Update your newspaper website URL, username, and password
   - Configure your storage provider settings (R2 or S3)
   - Configure your email service settings (SendGrid or Mailgun)
   - Update the recipient email addresses

## Step 4: Test the Application

Run the application manually to test that everything is working:

```bash
python run_newspaper.py
```

This will:
1. Log into your newspaper website and download the daily edition
2. Generate a thumbnail of the first page
3. Upload the newspaper and thumbnail to cloud storage
4. Send an email with links to the current and past newspapers

## Step 5: Set Up Scheduled Execution

### For Windows:

Run the PowerShell script to create a scheduled task:

```powershell
# Run as administrator
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File schedule_task.ps1
```

This will create a scheduled task that runs daily at 6:00 AM. You can modify the schedule in Task Scheduler if needed.

### For Linux/macOS:

Set up a cron job to run the script daily:

1. Open your crontab:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add a line to run the script daily at 6:00 AM:
   ```
   0 6 * * * /usr/bin/python /path/to/your/run_newspaper.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- Check the log file at `~/.newspaper/newspaper.log` for detailed error messages
- Ensure your newspaper website hasn't changed its login or download process
- Verify your cloud storage credentials have proper permissions
- Check your email service dashboard for errors or limits

## Important Notes

- Ensure your automation complies with the Terms of Service of your newspaper subscription
- Keep your credentials secure and never share them
- Cloud storage and email services are used within their free tiers
- The system keeps the last 7 days of newspapers (including today)

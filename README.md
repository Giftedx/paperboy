| `STORAGE_PROVIDER` | Set to `R2` or `S3` |
| `STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` | Name of your storage bucket |
| `EMAIL_SERVICE` | Set to `sendgrid` or `mailgun` |
| `EMAIL_SENDER` | Your verified sender email |
| `MAILING_LIST` | Comma-separated list of recipient emails |

**Cloud Storage Secrets:**

For R2:
```
R2_ACCOUNT_ID
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
R2_PUBLIC_URL_PREFIX (URL where files can be accessed)
```

For S3:
```
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
S3_REGION
S3_PUBLIC_URL_PREFIX (optional)
```

**Email Service Secrets:**

SENDGRID_API_KEY
```

For Mailgun:
```
MAILGUN_API_KEY
MAILGUN_DOMAIN
```

**Optional Secrets:**

```

DOWNLOAD_LINK_SELECTOR (CSS selector to find download link)
EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX (default: "Daily Newspaper")
```

### 6. Customize the Email Template (Optional)

If you want to customize the email appearance, you can modify `templates/email_template.html`.

### 7. Enable GitHub Actions

Make sure GitHub Actions are enabled for your repository. The workflow is scheduled to run daily at 6:00 AM UTC, but you can modify this in `.github/workflows/daily_newspaper.yaml`.

### 8. Manual Testing

You can manually trigger the workflow from the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to test the setup before the scheduled run.

## üìã Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Ensure all secrets are correctly configured
3. Verify your newspaper website hasn't changed its login or download process
4. Confirm your cloud storage credentials have proper permissions
5. Verify your email service is properly set up

Common issues:

- **Login failures:** The newspaper site might use non-standard login forms; try setting `DOWNLOAD_LINK_SELECTOR` to a specific CSS selector
- **Download issues:** If the site uses complex JavaScript, the system will automatically try Playwright as a fallback
- **Storage errors:** Verify your bucket permissions and credentials
- **Email failures:** Check your email service dashboard for errors or limits

## üîÑ How It Works

1. The GitHub Action runs at the scheduled time (6:00 AM UTC daily)
2. The script logs into your newspaper website and downloads the daily edition
3. It generates a thumbnail of the first page
4. The newspaper and thumbnail are uploaded to cloud storage
5. Old newspapers (beyond 7 days) are automatically removed
6. An email with links to all available newspapers is sent to your mailing list

## üìù License

This project is available under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.

## üí° Customization

- **Email Frequency:** Modify the cron schedule in the workflow file
- **Storage Duration:** Change the `RETENTION_DAYS` variable in `main.py` (default: 7 days)
- **Appearance:** Modify the HTML email template in `templates/email_template.html`
